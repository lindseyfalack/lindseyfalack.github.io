        <p>With an astonishing 15,000 kilometres of coastline featuring a variety of breaks, waves, points and reefs, it’s no wonder New Zealand is a world-class surfing destination. It’s as though nature designed the New Zealand coastline with surfers in mind. Tiny coves, long sandy beaches and sandbars and reefs - the diversity and consistency of surfing conditions here is as remarkable as the stunning coastline itself.</p>

        </div>


      <p>Australia is renowned as one of the world's premier surfing destinations. Surfing underpins an important part of the Australian coastal fabric. It forms part of a lifestyle in which millions participate and which millions more have an interest. Australian surfboard-makers have driven innovation in surfboard design and production since the mid-1960s. The country has launched corporate giants such as Billabong, Rip Curl and Quiksilver.</p></li>

      <li> <b> Costa Rica</b>

      <p>Surfing is big in California to say the least. It’s a way of life for many and a spectator sport for others. Up and down the coast there are worthy surf spots, not just in Southern California (even though they have the best-known breaks). Central and Northern California have several surfing beaches that rival the south, but you will need a thicker wetsuit!</p></li>

      <h3> Kelly Slater's Wave Pool</h3>
        <img src="images/wavepool.jpg" alt="wave pool">

        <p>Surfers have long dreamed of technology that could create perfect barreling waves. Now one of the greatest surfers of all time believes he has cracked the code.

Kelly Slater, an 11-time world champion, teamed up with engineers and scientists to create a specially-designed, 100-ton hydrofoil. It’s pulled along the length of a 700-yard track, resulting in six-foot waves that last about one minute. The wave system, which is located in Lemoore, California, can produce more than 50 types of waves at the push of a button.

“Our goal was to go and create a wave that was like an ocean swell,” Slater told CNBC. “It’s not like a sort of novelty or a low-energy wave. It’s a strong wave. You wipe out and feel it. A friend of mine broke four surfboards in here yesterday. We had a couple little minor injuries, nothing bad. But the wave pushes you around and that’s the difference.”</p>

        <li> <b>Surfaid</b>
        <p>Started by a group of concerned surfers in 2000 who were struck by the needless suffering and preventable death in the Mentawai Islands. Today we are proud that more than 95 per cent of our program staff are Indonesian nationals who work hand-in-hand with the communities of Western Sumatra, Sumbawa and Sumba, to bring about positive, sustainable health change while respecting the unique culture and customs of these islands communities. <br>

      <p>The Surfrider Foundation is a community of everyday people who passionately protect our playground – the ocean, waves, and beaches -that provide us so much enjoyment. Surfriders focus is 100% on protecting and preserving our ocean, beaches & waves.<br>

      <li><b>Pure (World Surf League)</b>
      <p>There’s no shortage of serious ocean issues to confront. But there are tons of people ready to help. There’s you, us, and the ocean advocacy organizations on the front lines creating real impact.By raising our voices together, we can turn the tide.We’ll start by shining a light on the people making a difference.

      <li><b>Waves for Water</b>
      <p>The Waves For Water objective is to identify the problem and quickly connect an existing user-friendly solution. The long-term goal for Waves For Water is to be proactive, rather than reactive. There is no reason anyone should die from lack of clean water, people have already done the hard work and have developed technology solutions that help eliminate senseless deaths. It is our job to make sure that technological solutions and quality education are in the hands of those who need them. In addition, individuals who are traveling to areas in need can easily eliminate the distribution challenges most bureaucracies face in philanthropic aid programs. One in six people still do not have access to clean water and that is ridiculous, we strongly believe that as a group, as a movement, we can solve this problem in our lifetime.<br>

      <li> <b>Surfers Against Sewage</b>
      <p>Surfers Against Sewage is widely recognised as one of the UK’s leading marine conservation charities. Surfers Against Sewage today deals with a wide spectrum of marine conservation issues from marine litter to climate change. Not just surfers – not just sewage.Surfers Against Sewage was set up by people just like us; people who were sick of seeing sewage in our seas and on our beaches in the 1980’s and 1990’s.  Worse still, they were fed up of getting ill when doing the sports they loved – surfing, sea swimming, windsurfing and anything else that involved being in the sea.<br>
