<!-- our steps -->

<div class="text">


<section id="step1">
  <img src="images/wax.jpg" alt="wax board">
  <p>Surfboard wax is used to help you stick to your board while surfing. The hard shell of a surfboard is slippery, which is good for the side in the water, but not good for under your feet. A good wax job creates bumps which give your feet something to grip to.</p>

<section id="step2">  <img src="images/leash.jpg" alt="">
  <p>The surfboard leash is a urethane cord that attaches to the tail of a surfboard and worn around a surfers ankle with the use of a Velcro strap. The purpose of the leash is to keep your surfboard close to you after sustaining a wipeout. Depending on whether you are goofy or regular, you either put it on your right or left ankle. Left is for goofy | Right is for regular. </p></section>
<section id="step3">  <img src="images/stretch.jpg" alt="">
  <p>It is important to stretch before surfing to avoid muscle pain and injury. Surfing requires some degree of flexibility and while our expert surf instructors are able to get anyone up and riding on a surfboard, the more flexible you are the easier it will be to catch that first wave. Some of the key areas to stretch before surfing are the shoulders, legs, neck and back.</p></section>
<section id="step4">  <img src="images/paddle.jpg" alt="">
  <p>Paddling out to the lineup could be very tiring, which is why you should search for a channel. What is a channel? Basically as waves go to shore, they bring water in with them, that water needs to go back out to sea somewhere and water always finds the path of least resistance.  There are certain spots where the water is literally channeled back out to sea.  These spots are usually deeper, and so the waves aren't breaking in them, which means there is less resistance coming at you.  So do the math, +1 water moving out to sea, -1 waves going towards shore = +2 a good place to paddle out. Once your at the lineup, where the waves aren't breaking anymore, is when you sit on your board and wait for a good set to roll in.</p></section>
<section id="step5">  <img src="images/lineup.jpg" alt="">
  <p>It's important to observe the correct etiquette while out surfing, otherwise things will just descend in to total chaos. There are unwritten rules about a lineup you shoudl respect. Make sure to look down the line before taking a wave, so you don't cut anyone off - #1 way to piss off another surfer. Do not hog the waves. Respect the locals. Just wait for that perfect wave, while keeping yourself out of trouble.

    The surfing pop-up is essentially an explosive push up. This is how you get to your feet on a surfboard! To make the pop-up easier, practice several pop ups on dry land every day. This will build up your arm strength and give you some muscle memory. When it comes time to do it on a surfboard you’ll have a much easier time.
    Everyone’s surfing pop-up is slightly different, but for all intents and purposes the pop-up technique is basically the same for everyone. The pop-up should be a single fluid motion. Don’t worry if you don’t get it exactly right the first few times. It will come with practice. You’ll also need to build up some muscles.

You did it! Now you are riding the wave! Keep your knees bent and ride along the wave, not to shore. Depending on which way the wave is breaking, is if you should paddle into the wave left or right. Stay stoked and enjoy the ride!
